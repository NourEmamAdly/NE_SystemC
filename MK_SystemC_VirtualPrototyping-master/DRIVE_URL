Points Covered in each Exercise:

Exercise 2:
- Implementation of a nand gate module
- Using nand gates to create an xor (Hierarchical Binding)
- Understanding given stimulus and monitor files
- Debugging using GTKWave
- Adding sc_clock
Exercise 3:
- State machine implementation using switch cases on Regex Expression.
Exercise 4:
- Petri Net implementation using custom interfaces, templated ports, multiports and channels.
Exercise 5:
- Kahn Process Network implementation using sc_fifo<T>
Exercise 6:
- TLM Loosely Timed: Single Initiator/ Target, Multiple Initiator/ Target, Temporal Decoupling

Hard Points Covered in Lectures:

Lecture 2:
- Binding (Connecting) Modules > P. 58, 59

Lecture 3:
- Ports, Signals, Interfaces and Channels > P. 15 to 17 and 
- Implement Custom Channel > Code in L3_SC_advance/0.Done/custom_fifo > also sc has a sc_fifo<T> see Primitive Channels below
- Primitive Channels sc_signal/buffer/fifo/mutex/semaphore > P.25 to 30. 
    -IN FIFO: CHECK SLIDES FOR NON-BLOCKING AND BLOCKING WRITE/READ
- Ports, Port Arrays, Multiports > P.37 to 
- Other topics: custom Signal, event finders, dynamic processes, report handling, callbacks

Lecture 4:
- Started with a simple custom tlm implementation.
- Blocking Loosely Timed Initator and target > code: tlm_lt_initiator_target. Unlike the custom, this is standard complient.
- Building an interconnect component to blocking LT Init/target > code: tlm_lt_initiator_interconnect_target
- Temporal decoupling > tlm_quantum_keeper
- Direct Memory Interface > tlm_lt_dmi
- Debug transport


OTHER:

SC_Clock:
    sc_clock clk1("clk1", 1, SC_NS, 0.5, 0, SC_NS, true);
    /*
    sc_clock(const char* name_, const sc_time& period_, double duty_cycle_ = 0.5, const sc_time& start_time_ = SC_ZERO_TIME, bool posedge_first_ = true );
    */
    // MK_GPT: Defines a SystemC clock named 'clk1' with a period of 1 nanosecond (1, SC_NS) and a duty cycle of 50% (0.5).
    // MK_GPT: The clock is initially set to 0 nanoseconds (0), and it has a phase shift of 0 nanoseconds (0, SC_NS).
    // MK_GPT: The last argument 'true' indicates that the clock starts with a rising edge.
